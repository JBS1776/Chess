# Chess project Sommers

A fun summer project I have been working on in my spare time.  Every piece currently moves as intended in a real game of Chess with the exception of checking whether or not moving the piece towards a given position will result in their King being placed in check. Running it is only a matter of compiling the Game.java file. The interface will subsequently appear with each of the 32 black and white chess pieces appearing on it.  </br>
</br>
If you are compiling this with eclipse, move the sprites folder from Chess/src to Chess.  Placing the sprites folder in the wrong place will result in the pieces being invisible with the rest of the interface features being fully operational.</br>
There exists a menu bar but most of its features don't work yet.  The game also won't yet detect whether or not the King is in check.  </br>
In the future, I will update the game so that these features work properly and so the code is much more readable.
