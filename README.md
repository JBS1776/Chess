# Chess project Sommers

A fun summer project I have been working on in my spare time.  Every piece currently moves as intended in a real game of Chess with the exception of checking whether or not moving the piece towards a given position will result in their King being placed in check. Running it is only a matter of compiling the Game.java file. The interface will subsequently appear with each of the 32 black and white chess pieces appearing on it.  </br>
</br>
If you are compiling this with eclipse, move the sprites folder from Chess/src to Chess.  Placing the sprites folder in the wrong place will result in the pieces being invisible with the rest of the interface features being fully operational.</br>
As of the December 2018 update to this game, most of the menu features are fully functional.  Saving a game from the menu bar is not available yet.  This will be fixed in a later update.</br>
Core gameplay with regular and take-me chess work properly.  The settings let you choose which mode of chess you wish to play.  </br>
This app won't allow you to make any illegal moves.  Pieces won't be allowed to move where they cannot move.  For instance, assuming you are playing regular chess, you won't be allowed to make a move that will put or keep your King in check.</br>  In take-me chess, capturing an opponent's piece, when possible, is required.  Like all other pieces, the King can be captured in take-me chess.
