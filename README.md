# Chess project Sommers

A fun summer project I have been working on in my spare time.  Every piece currently moves as intended in a real game of Chess. </br>
If you are compiling this with eclipse, move the sprites folder from Chess/src to Chess.  </br>
There exists a menu bar but most of those features don't work yet.  The game also won't yet detect whether or not the King is in check.  </br>
In the future, I will update the game so that these features work properly and so the code is much more readable.
